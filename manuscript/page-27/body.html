I had but one friend in the College, or, indeed, in the world—perhaps it was he.</p><p>Just then the person outside the door coughed, and I hastened to open it, for I knew the cough.</p><p>A tall man of about thirty, with the remains of great personal beauty, came hurrying in, staggering beneath the weight of a massive iron box which he carried by a handle with his right hand. He placed the box upon the table, and then fell into an awful fit of coughing. He coughed and coughed till his face became quite purple, and at last he sank into a chair and began to spit up blood. I poured out some whisky into a tumbler, and gave it to him. He drank it, and seemed better; though his better was very bad indeed.</p></div> </div>
