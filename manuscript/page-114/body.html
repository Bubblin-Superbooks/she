Three miles or more to our starboard is a low dim line. It is the Eastern shore of Central Africa. We are running to the southward, before the North East Monsoon, between the mainland and the reef that for hundreds of miles fringes this perilous coast. The night is quiet, so quiet that a whisper can be heard fore and aft the dhow; so quiet that a faint booming sound rolls across the water to us from the distant land.</p><p>The Arab at the tiller holds up his hand, and says one word:—“<em>Simba</em> (lion)!”</p><p>We all sit up and listen. Then it comes again, a slow, majestic sound, that thrills us to the marrow.</p><p>“To-morrow by ten o’clock,” I say, “we ought, if the Captain is not out in his reckoning, which I think very probable, to make this mysterious rock with a man’s head, and begin our shooting.”</p></div> </div>
