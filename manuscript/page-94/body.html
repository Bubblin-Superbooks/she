It is executed in black letter, written over the crosses or Crusaders’ swords, and dated fourteen hundred and forty-five. As the best plan will be to allow it to speak for itself, I here give the black-letter fac-simile, together with the original Latin without the contractions, from which it will be seen that the writer was a fair mediæval Latinist. Also we discovered what is still more curious, an English version of the black-letter Latin. This, also written in black letter, we found inscribed on a second parchment that was in the coffer, apparently somewhat older in date than that on which was inscribed the mediæval Latin translation of the uncial Greek of which I shall speak presently. This I also give in full.</p><p><em>Fac-simile of Black-Letter Inscription on the Sherd of Amenartas.</em></p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">“Iſta reliq̅ia eſt valde miſticu̅ et myrificu̅ op̅s q̅d</p></div> </div>
