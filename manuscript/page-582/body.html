   by the reflection that he was under the direct protection of
   <em>She</em>. It struck Leo and myself as very curious that a
   people which has no objection to living amongst the dead,
   with whom their familiarity has perhaps bred contempt, and
   even using their bodies for purposes of fuel, should be
   terrified at approaching the habitations that these very
   departed had occupied when alive. After all, however, it is
   only a savage inconsistency.â€”L. H.</blockquote></div> </div>
